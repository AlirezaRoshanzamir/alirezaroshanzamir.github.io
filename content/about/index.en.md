I am Alireza Roshanzamir, born in 1996 - you can do the math to find out my age since I can't increment a number each year here :). I'm married and deeply devoted to my family, life, and my spouse.

In the professional realm, I have an intense passion for computers and software engineering, including programming, design, architecture, testing, requirements engineering, methodologies, and more. I thoroughly enjoy reading technical computer books, and for non-technical matters, I prefer audiobooks.

I have a strong affinity for horror films and have used them to unwind during intense periods in my life.

Continuing, I will share some highlights from different stages of my life.

### High School and the Start of Programming
My journey into programming began during the last year of middle school with VB6.0. The appealing graphical environment and simplicity of the language captivated me. The following year, due to a research project at school, I started learning C# versions 2005 and 2008. During that period, Windows Form with its array of controls known as RAD (like Telerik and DevExpress) further deepened my passion for programming. In my second year of high school, I delved into the field of artificial intelligence. Over two years, I developed a "Behavioral Pattern-Based Identity Verification System" project with my team, which earned us the third place nationwide in the Kharazmi Youth Festival.

### Education
During the final year of high school, I exerted significant effort on the entrance exam and secured admission to Tehran University's Software Engineering program, ranking 212th in the whole country. Having prior programming experience gave me an edge, and I consistently performed well in projects and assignments. With a cumulative GPA of 19.40/20, I attained the first rank across all technical fields at the university. Concurrently, in my fourth year of high school, I participated in the national Olympiad for university students and emerged as the first rank.

My undergraduate project focused on "Load Balancing in the Stock Exchange," guided by professors Dr. Ramtin Khosravi and Dr. Ehsan Khamespanah. The main challenge was optimizing performance through load distribution while ensuring equity, an essential aspect in stock exchanges. I developed a model that linearly increased performance with the number of processing nodes while adhering to restrictions.

For my Master's, due to my Olympiad rank, I gained direct entry to Sharif University's AI program. My project centered on "Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Speech Tests," guided by Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani and Dr. Hamid Karbalayi. I focused on text-based models (BERT, XLNet, XLM, Word2Vec, etc.) and incorporated audio models (like Wav2Vec). I achieved an 88% accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's from transcribed speech. The project culminated in a Q1 journal publication. A larger initiative I initiated with medical professionals in neuroscience and speech therapy involved analyzing Persian-language data for a similar test, but due to COVID-19 and other issues, this project was delayed.

### Work
I initiated my professional career during my bachelors at Resa startup (Resalat Salamat Iranian). The startup aimed to enhance communication between patients and doctors. I was deeply engaged with concepts such as VoIP, website development, web services, mobile applications, etc. Microsoft technologies were prevalent, including C#, ASP.NET MVC, Xamarin, UCMA, and more. At the end of my tenure, we accommodated thousands of patients and hundreds of active doctors.

After Resa, I transitioned to larger companies and joined Mahsan. Given the security nature of projects (often network-centric) and their emphasis on performance, many products were developed in C++. I worked in the VoIP team at Mahsan, focusing on data leakage prevention (DLP). I also conducted small courses on testing and software design, promoting these practices in the C++ domain.

With the quality concerns I encountered in my early Mahsan years, I advanced to the Quality Team Technical Leader role. During this time, I contributed to quality metrics, policies, implementation, and infrastructure. Details are available in my resume and LinkedIn. We implemented our products using Python, often extending frameworks to match specific needs. While I enjoyed programming, I actively pursued architectural and testing practices, even conducting courses on CI/CD, Acceptance Test, Artifactory, Monorepo, and Living Documentation.
